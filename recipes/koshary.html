    <h1>Koshary</h1>
    <img src="../images/koshari.jpg">
    <h2>Koshary is pretty much Egypt's staple street food.</h2>
    <p>You can find anything from a 2-story koshary restaurant to a man with a cart on the side of the street. It has no meat, but even the biggest of carnivores don't miss it.</p>
    <p>t has no meat, but even the biggest of carnivores don't miss it. Filling and healthy, come see Egypt's most famous dish! Instead of French-fried onions, I use my black pepper onion rings on here.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>package ditalini pasta.</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups short-grain rice, rinsed.</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups dark brown lentils. </li>
        <li>1 yellow onion, minced</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can crushed tomatoes .</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced.</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 (3 ounce) can French-fried onions</li>
    </ul> 
    <h3>Recipe instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the chickpeas, vinegar, coriander, cayenne pepper, and cumin in a resealable bag or container with a tight-fitting lid. Store in refrigerator while prepping remainder of dish, shaking occasionally.</li>
        <li>Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Cook the ditalani pasta in the boiling water until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Combine the rice with enough cold water to cover; allow to soak for 20 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine the lentils with enough water to cover in a pot; season with salt and pepper. Bring the lentils to a boil and cook at a boil until tender, about 30 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat; cook and stir the onion and garlic in the hot oil until translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the crushed tomatoes, season with salt and pepper, reduce heat to medium-low, and maintain at a simmer while preparing remainder of dish.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in a pot over medium-high heat. Add the rice to the butter, increase heat to high, and fry for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Pour the chicken stock over the rice; bring to a boil. Season the rice mixture with salt and pepper, reduce heat to low, cover the pot, and cook until rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix the rice and lentils together on a large serving platter. Spread the cooked ditalani over the rice and lentil mixture. Serve with the marinated chickpeas, the tomato sauce, and the French-fried onions as condiments.</li>
