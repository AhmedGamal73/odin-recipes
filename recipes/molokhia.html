        <li>Frozen Molokhia</li>

    <h3>Recipe instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a deep pot over medium-high heat melt ghee.</li> 
        <li>Saut√© garlic for 15-30 seconds.</li> 
        <li>Until lightly golden and fragrant as shown in picture 3.</li> 
        <li>Add coriander and keep stirring for another 30 seconds.</li> 
        <li>The coriander will give its fragrance and turn a little more dark brown.</li> 
        <li>Pour in some of the broth keeping the rest after we check consistency at the end.</li> 
        <li>Sprinkle the bouillon cube. Stir until it is dissolved. </li>

        <li>Molokhia will slowly melt in the broth. Wait until it has completely melted.</li>
